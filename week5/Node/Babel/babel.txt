BABEL:

->Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. 
Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

->Transform syntax
->Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill)
->Source code transformations (codemods)
->And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)

->Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers.

These plugins allow you to use new syntax, right now without waiting for browser support.

// Babel Input: ES2015 arrow function
[1, 2, 3].map((n) => n + 1);

// Babel Output: ES5 equivalent
[1, 2, 3].map(function(n) {
  return n + 1;
});

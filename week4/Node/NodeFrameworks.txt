BEST NODEJS FRAMEWORKS:

-> Node.js, it has found a way to server-side implementation thus reducing the complexity of using two different languages at both ends.
->Node.js offers one of the most innovative solutions to building servers and web/mobile applications.
-> Its single-threaded event looping and asynchronous, non-blocking input/output processing feature distinguish it from other runtime environments. 
-> several performance-driven frameworks are being developed using primary principles and approaches of Node.js.
-> These frameworks have extended the functionality of Node.js to a considerable extent and have also built newer features.
-> frameworks like Express.js and Hapi.js are gaining prominence for designing better websites and mobile applications.
 
Best Node.js Frameworks, which are currently redefining the application development field.

7.Sails.js
8.Koa.js
9.Total.js
10.Mojito

1.HAPI:
->Hapi.js is a powerful Node.js web framework for building application program interfaces (APIs) and other software applications. 
The framework has a robust plugin system and numerous key features:
 input validation,
configuration-based functionality
implement caching
error handling 
logging etc
-> it is used for providing technology solutions by several large-scale websites, such as Disney, Concrete, PayPal, Walmart and more.

2.SOCKET.IO:
->Socket.io is a Node.js server framework for building real-time web applications. Being a Javascript library, it allows event-driven, bidirectional communication between web clients and server. 
-> Socket.io works as a client-side library running in the browser and as a server-side library for node.js.
->key features also include asynchronous input/ output (I/O) processing, binary streaming, instant messaging (chat application)

3.EXPRESS.JS:
->Express.js is one of the essential web frameworks for Node.js. It is a minimalist framework for building a host of web and mobile applications as well as application programming interfaces (APIs).

4.MOJITO:
->Mojito is a JavaScript framework based on Yahoo! Cocktails, a mobile application development platform introduced by Yahoo! Developer Network
->it can run in both clientside and serverside.
->Mojito is a model-view controller (MVC) framework offering a gamut of features, such as

Convenient data fetching.
Local development environment and tools (Yahoo! independent stack).
Integrated unit testing.
Library for simplifying internationalization & localization.

5.METEOR:
->Meteor is an open-source, model-view controller (MVC) framework for building websites and web/mobile applications. The framework supports OS X, Windows, and Linux.
->It allows writing both client and server parts of an application in JavaScript.
-> it has  inbuilt set of pre-written, self-contained modules which helps in writing application codes.
->applicarion developed using this framework is Blonk (Job search mobile App) .

6.DERBY:
->Derby is a model-view controller (MVC) JavaScript framework for both client-side and server-side. It is ideal for creating real-time mobile and web applications.
-> Derby's Racer, a real-time data synchronization engine for Node.js allows multi-site, real-time concurrency and data synchronization across clients and servers.

7.MEAN.JS:
->Mean stands for MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js
->Mean.js is a full-fledged JavaScript framework to build web applications using NoSQL database, MongoDB as well as Angular.js for the front-end and Express.js/Node.js for the backend (server)
->application developed using this framework is Ziploop(shopping app).

8.Sails.js
->Sails.js is one of the most popular real-time frameworks around for building Node.js applications. Sails.js offers MVC pattern for implementing data-driven application programming interfaces (APIs).
-> The framework has gained ground for building real-time chat applications, dashboards and multiplayer games. 

9.KOA.JS:
->Koa.js is a powerful server framework for Node.js to build efficient web applications and application programming interfaces (APIs). 
->Koa.js efficiently uses generators to efficiently deal with call backs and increase error-handling capabilities. 
->This also improves readability of the application.

10.TOTAL.JS:
->Total.js is one of the modern and modular Node.js frameworks supporting model-view controller (MVC) software architecture.
-> It is fully compatible with various client-side frameworks, like Angular.js, Polymer, Backbone.js, Bootstrap and more.
->It supports RESTful routing mechanism, supports web sockets, media streaming and more.

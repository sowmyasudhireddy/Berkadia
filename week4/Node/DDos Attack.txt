DDOS ATTACK:
->DDoS is distributed denial-of-service  attack
->DDos attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
->DDos attack is like Trafficjam.

HOW it works?
1.A DDoS attack requires an attacker to gain control of a network of online machines in order to carry out an attack.
 Computers and other machines are infected with malware, turning each one into a bot . The attacker then has remote control over the group of bots, which is called a botnet.
2. Once a botnet has been established, the attacker is able to direct the machines by sending updated instructions to each bot via a method of remote control.
->When the IP address of a victim is targeted by the botnet, each bot will respond by sending requests to the target, potentially causing the targeted server or network to overflow capacity,
 resulting in a denial-of-service to normal traffic.

TYPES:
1.Application Layer Attack
2.Protocols Attack
3.Volumetric Attacks

Process of mitigating DDos Attacks:

1.Black Hole Routing
2.Rate Limiting
3.web application firewall
4.Anycast Network Diffusion
